Strictly follow the rules here when writing Python.

# Version
- By default, assume the 3.12 version. This means that you can use the newest Python syntax and features, such as pattern matching.

# Coding style
- Do not care too much about formatting; it will be handled by ruff. 
- Avoid lambda function when it becomes too complex. 

# Typing
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` by default.
- Always type the function arguments.
- Type other variables and function returns only when necessary.
- Use the newer syntax, including:
    - Use the builtin container (e.g. `list[int]`) over typing (e.g. `typing.List[int]`). Please note that `Callable` is an exception.
    - Use `|` over `Union`
    - Use `<type> | None` over `Optional[<type>]`.
    - Use type statement over `TypeAlias`
    - Use type argument (i.e. `[T, *S, **P]`) over `TypeVar`
- You might still have to import some types from `typing`, for example `Literal, Concatenate`.

# Builtin libraries
- Always use `pathlib` over `os.path` when possible.

# Common libraries
- We use pydantic by default.
